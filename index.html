        <h4>'History is written by the survivors ,and Iam surely that'.</h4>
        <h6>Catherine de'Medici</h6>
        <p>The character <span style="color:brown">'Catherine de'Medici</span> from the Tv series-<span style="color:brown">'Reign'</span> is my favourite character of all times.This character was played by Hollywood tv personality 'Megan Follows'.Megan has done amazing justification to the role of Queen of France-'Catherine de' Medici'.This character has portrayed all the different emotions a person has to go through in his or her lifetime.Megan confidently played the part and very convincingly made us believe that she is 'The Queen Of France'.There are instances in the series where you can find her portraying the role of a mother,a queen,a wife,a lover,a fighter and definietly 'A Survivor'.She is good at scheming,plotting and also causing murders to get her way in life and politics.She will stop at nothing to protect her family,legacy and power.She is an extremely shrewd politician who has spies and contacts all throughtout the French court and the French aritrocasy who help her maintain her and her family's hold on power.She has no qualms about blackmailing people into her service and punishing those who betray her.</p></section>

             Queen Catherine is an unpredictable, complex, and fascinating woman: no one would know for sure what to expect from her, and though her actions could be interpreted as cold and cruel, no one could question or doubt her love and devotion to her children. Her tumultuous and ultimately bittersweet relationship with Mary was also a testament to the fact that she does have a sense of compassion and decency but was forced to restrain them when she needed to in order to pursue what she deemed best for her children and her country.
